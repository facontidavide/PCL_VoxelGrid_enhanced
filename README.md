# PCL_VoxelGrid_enhanced

This repository contains a fixed version of **pcl::VoxelGrid** that uses spread sort instead of std::sort.

Additionally, a benchamark application is provided; requires Google Benchamark, that can be easily installed in Ubuntu with:

    sudo apt install libbenchmark-dev

This fix has been already submitted as aPull request to PCL.
